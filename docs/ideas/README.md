# ideas
some ideas what I find interesting to add to the thesis and research:

- try separating image sets for colorful and not-colorful insects
  - can we achieve transfer learning with the final architecture and try training on color/non color images first then test with the opposite set
- we can also try to convert all images to b\w in the preprocessing step
