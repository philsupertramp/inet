## Thesis: Machine Learning Methods for Localization and Classification of Insects in Images
A look into ML methods for single object detection, solving the tasks of insect genera classification
and bounding box regression, individually as well as simultaneously.

## Abstract
This thesis has been written in the citizen science project KInsekt at
the Berliner Hochschule f ̈ur Technik. Its main objective is to investigate
different Machine Learning techniques for the localization and classifi-
cation of insect orders, namely ”Coleoptera”, ”Hymenoptera, Formici-
dae”, ”Lepidoptera”, ”Hemiptera” and ”Ordonata”, based on image files.
The accompanying code repository (https://gitlab.com/kinsecta/ml/
thesisphilipp and https://github.com/philsupertramp/inet) contains software written in Python (version 3.6.9), de-
veloped using the libraries numpy,
tensorflow, keras, keras-tuner and scikit-learn. The code has
been written in the attempt to be easily extendable or changeable, to e.g.
append the list of available classification classes.
All used algorithms and ”random” generated numbers are seeded, using
the seed 42.
The Machine Learning model is supposed to run efficiently on a small
computer, such as the RaspberryPi, therefore widely used architectures
can not simply be used.
This thesis contains a brief description of the Machine Learning pipeline
from data collection, and preparation to preprocessing of the data set and
finally using the resulting data set to train different models and archi-
tectures. At the end, the best models, based on predefined metrics, will
be chosen and its performance against state-of-the-art architectures, in-
cluding YOLO, evaluated. The results of this evaluation will then reveal
that custom tailored architectures perform worse on the given task, when
compared to SotA architectures.

## Installation

### Prerequesites:
- `python >= 3.8, virtualenv`, optional `docker`
- set environment variables according to `./scripts/mount_directories.sh`

## Usage
### Datasets
To optain the data set, either contact me via [gh issue](https://github.com/philsupertramp/inet/issues/new) or through any other channel mentioned on my [gh page](https://github.com/philsupertramp), or by following the steps below.

#### recreate a pre-labelled training set
##### Recreate the data set from iNaturalist Competition 2021
You can find the iNaturalist Competition Data set at the bottom of [this page](https://github.com/visipedia/inat_comp/tree/master/2021).

1. Download the "Train" data set
2. Extract subset for only "insecta" classes (place it under `mnt/KInsektDaten/data/iNat/train_Insecta`)
3. Run  
```shell
$ python -m scripts.reuse_labels bounding-boxes-2022-02-12-14-33.json mnt/KInsektDaten/data/iNat/train_Insecta/ data/iNat/storage
```
#### generate a training set:

1. To generate a dataset from the source `mnt/KInsektDaten/data/iNat/train_Insecta/`:
    ```shell
    $ python -m scripts.preselect_files --seed 42 -g 20 -s 25 -rng -l ../mnt/KInsektDaten/data/iNat/train_Insecta/ ../data/iNat/
    ```
for more options see `-h`.
2. Upload the files within the (default) target directory `./data/iNat/storage` into ["Label-Studio"](https://labelstudio-kinsekt.app.datexis.com) and annotate bounding boxes.

optionally Launch [LabelStudio](https://labelstud.io/)

    $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/data/iNat:/label-studio/data -e LABEL_STUDIO_LOCAL_FILES_SERVING_ENABLED=true -e LABEL_STUDIO_LOCAL_FILES_DOCUMENT_ROOT=/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
3. Create labels for image files
4. Export the labels from LStudio
5. Generate file structure for train, test and validation sets by running
```shell
$ python -m scripts.process_files -input_directory data/iNat/storage -output_directory data/iNat/data -test 0.1 -val 0.2 bounding-boxes-2022-02-12-14-33.json
```
6. Generate cropped dataset for classification task
```shell
$ python -m scripts.generate_cropped_dataset data/iNat/
```

### Inference tests
To test inference of trained models run scripts from the `./tests` directory.

#### `test_tf_architectures.py`
Executes inference tests on pretrained optimized instances of
- `IndependentModel`
- `TwoStageModel`
- `SingleStageModel`

#### `test_yolo_inference.py`
Executes inference tests on [YoloV5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

#### `test_tf_lite_architectures.py`
Executes inference tests on TFLite compatible versions of pretrained optimized instances of
- `IndependentModel`
- `TwoStageModel`
- `SingleStageModel`
